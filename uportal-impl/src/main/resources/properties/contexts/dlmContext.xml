        This file sets up contextual information for Distributed Layout 
        Management. It is intentionally not included in beanRefFactory.xml so 
        that it only gets loaded if DLM is being used for layout management and 
        also to ensure that exceptions caused during loading of beanRefFactory
        don't stop this file from being loaded.

    <!--
        Configure the processing pipe for DLM including optional processors that 
        can be swapped in and out using the uP_dlmPrc parameter. WARNING: since 
        these processors are meant to hold user specific parameters and allow 
        changing the SAX event stream based on those values these beans MUST NOT
        be singletons. Each instance of the pipe must be a new instance with 
        all new embedded instances of processors for each user. Thus the 
        singleton="false" attribute on all of these beans. The only exception
        to this would be a processor that did not have any instance variables
        with user specific context. Such a processor could be used as a 
        singleton.
        
        The processing pipe conceptually sits in front of the 
        DistributedLayoutManager which maintains the user's layout and thus can
        provide IParameterProcessor implementations that can act on parameters
        passed as part of a request either every time as a member of the list of
        fixed processors or only when needed via being included in the optional
        processor map. 
        
        Only one optional processor is active at a time and is
        activated by including the parameter "uP_dlmPrc=aKey" where "aKey" 
        matches the corresponding key of the processor in the map in this file.
        An optional processor remains in place for all further requests until 
        another occurrance of uP_dlmPrc with an empty value or another key or
        the processor indicates via the optional interface 
        IOptionalParameterProcessor that it is finished and is no longer needed
        in parameter processing. For more indepth information see the javadocs 
        for the following class and interfaces:

        This will result in a valid processing pipe but won't inject a list of
        fixed processors nor a map of optional processors thus saving on a small
        amount of memory.
