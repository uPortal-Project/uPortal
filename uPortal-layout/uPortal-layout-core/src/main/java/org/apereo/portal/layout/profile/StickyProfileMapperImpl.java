/**
 * Profile mapper implementing sticky profile selection.
 *
 * <p>Stores selected profile fname (as looked up in injected Map keyed by profile key) into an
 * injected IProfileSelectionRegistry, but does not store under impersonation.
 *
 * <p>Translates a configured profile key (default: "default") to mean apathy, which is to say
 * clearing any stored profile selection. This allows users selecting the default profile key (as
 * "default") to have no stored selection at all and thereby get the default profile selection
 * behavior, where just what that default selection behavior in the rest of the profile mapping
 * chain might change over time. This apathy translation takes priority over key->fname mapping --
 * if a key is both a key in the map and is the key configured to mean apathy, it is treated as
 * meaning apathy.
 *
 * <p>Reflects stored profile selection from the IProfileSelectionRegistry.
 *
 * <p>DOES NOT HAVE A DEFAULT PROFILE FNAME TO RETURN. If this mapper doesn't have anything
 * interesting to say about what user profile a user ought to have, it simply returns null, which is
 * the API defined way to say nothing.
 *
 * <p>Subsequent or upstream profile mappers can fall back on a default, see also
 * ChainingProfileMapperImpl.
 *
 * <p>Fails gracefully. If persisted profile selection if any cannot be determined, logs and returns
 * null indicating no available opinion about desired profile mapping.
 *
 * <p>Typically this mapper will be in the profile mapping chain within a ChainingProfileMapperImpl.
