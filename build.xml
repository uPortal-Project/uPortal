<!--
     This is the build.xml for uPortal which can be used in
     conjunction with Ant (http://ant.apache.org/) to
     build, deploy, and distribute the uPortal project. Type
     "ant -projecthelp" to see a list of ant targets.

     Notes:

     You shouldn't need to modify this file.  Instead, modify
     build.properties which contains configurable paths to jar
     files and other resources.

     "ant initportal" will deploy uPortal and load your database,
     but you must first set up the JDBC properties in
     rdbm.properties and possibly PersonDirs.xml,
     both of which are in the properties directory.

<!-- A "project" describes a set of targets that may be requested
     when Ant is executed.  The "default" attribute defines the
     target which is executed if no specific target is requested,
     and the "basedir" attribute defines the current working directory
     from which Ant executes the requested task.  This is normally
     set to the current working directory.
-->


<project name="uPortal" default="help" basedir=".">


<!-- ===================== Property Definitions =========================== -->

<!--

  Each of the following properties are used in the build script.
  Values for these properties are set by the first place they are
  defined, from the following list:
  * Definitions on the "ant" command line (ant -Ddeploy.home=xyz compile)
  * Definitions from a "build.properties" file in the top level
    source directory
  * Definitions from a "build.properties" file in the developer's
    home directory
  * Default definitions in this build.xml file

  You will note below that property values can be composed based on the
  contents of previously defined properties.  This is a powerful technique
  that helps you minimize the number of changes required when your development
  environment is modified.  Note that property composition is allowed within
  "build.properties" files as well as in the "build.xml" script.

-->

  <!-- Load user property definition overrides -->
  <property file="build.properties"/>
  <property file="${user.home}/build.properties"/>


<!-- ==================== File and Directory Names ======================== -->

<!--

  These properties generally define file and directory names (or paths) that
  affect where the build process stores its outputs.

  app.name             Base name of this application, used to
                       construct filenames and directories.
                       Defaults to "myapp".

  app.version          Version identifier for this application.

  build.home           The directory into which the "prepare" and
                       "compile" targets will generate their output.
                       Defaults to "build".

  server.home          The root directory of the application server
                       or servlet container such as Tomcat.

  webapp.docBase       The name of the context within the webcontainer

  webapp.path          URL path to the context

  webapp.contextFile   The name of the prototype context file

  deploy.home          The name of the directory into which the
                       deployment hierarchy will be created, and into
                       which the build directory will be copied.
                       Usually "{your_servlet_container_home}/webapps/{app.name}".

  dist.home            The name of the base directory in which
                       distribution files are created.
                       Defaults to "dist".

-->

  <property name="app.name"      value="(set this in build.properties!)"/>
  <property name="app.version"   value="(set this in build.properties!)"/>
  <property name="build.home"    value="build"/>
  <property name="server.home"   value="(set this in build.properties!)"/>
  <property name="deploy.home"   value="(set this in build.properties!)"/>
  <property name="dist.home"     value="dist"/>

  <property name="webapp.DocBase" value="(set this in build.properties!)"/>
  <property name="webapp.Path"   value="(set this in build.properties!)"/>
  <property name="webapp.contextFile" value="(set this in build.properties!)"/>

<!--  ==================== Compilation Control Options ==================== -->

<!--

  These properties control option settings on the Javac compiler when it
  is invoked using the <javac> task.

  compile.debug        Should compilation include the debug option?

  compile.deprecation  Should compilation include the deprecation option?

  compile.optimize     Should compilation include the optimize option?

-->

  <property name="compile.debug"       value="true"/>
  <property name="compile.deprecation" value="false"/>
  <property name="compile.optimize"    value="true"/>



<!-- ==================== External Dependencies =========================== -->


<!--

  Use property values to define the locations of external JAR files on which
  your application will depend.  In general, these values will be used for
  two purposes:
  * Inclusion on the classpath that is passed to the Javac compiler
  * Being copied into the "/WEB-INF/lib" directory during execution
    of the "deploy" target.

  Because we will automatically include all of the Java classes that Tomcat 4
  exposes to web applications, we will not need to explicitly list any of those
  dependencies.  You only need to worry about external dependencies for JAR
  files that you are going to include inside your "/WEB-INF/lib" directory.

  This version of uPortal requires the following jars:

  xalan.jar            Xalan is an XSLT processor for transforming XML documents
                       into HTML, text, or other XML document types.
                       IMPORTANT: See the following web pages that describe
                       the steps you need to take to ensure that the appropriate
                       version of Xalan is being used in your environment:
                       JDK 1.3: http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/faq.html#faq-N100AF
                       JDK 1.4: http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/faq.html#faq-N100CC
                       Version: 2.6.0
                       URL: http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/

  xercesImpl.jar       Xerces2 is the next generation of high performance,
                       fully compliant XML parsers in the Apache Xerces family.
                       Be sure to use the version of XercesImpl that comes with
                       the Xalan you are using.
                       Version: (depends on Xalan version)
                       URL: http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/

  xml-apis.jar         SAX, DOM, and JAVAX interfaces which have been recently
                       separated from the xalan and xerces jars.
                       Be sure to use the version of xml-apis.jar that comes with
                       the Xalan you are using.
                       Version: (depends on Xalan version)
                       URL: http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/

  tidy.jar             Turns HTML into well formed XHTML. There is a problem with
                       the current release that shows up when uPortal is deployed
                       in certain web containers including Tomcat 4.0.x.

  jdbcDriver.jar       This should contain the JDBC driver for whatever relational
                       database you plan to use.  For development, HypersonicSQL is
                       a nice choice.  For production, you probably want something
                       more robust like Oracle or PostgreSQL.

<!-- ==================== Compilation Classpath =========================== -->

<!--

  Rather than relying on the CLASSPATH environment variable, Ant includes
  features that makes it easy to dynamically construct the classpath you
  need for each compilation.  The example below constructs the compile
  classpath to include the servlet.jar file, as well as the other components
  that Tomcat makes available to web applications automatically, plus anything
  that you explicitly added.

-->

  <path id="compile.classpath">

    <!-- Include all JAR files that will be included in /WEB-INF/lib -->

    <pathelement location="${junit.jar}"/>
  	<pathelement location="lib/hsqldb.jar"/>
  </path>



<!-- ==================== Help target ===================================== -->
<!--

  The "help" target prints a help message describing the available targets.
  This target is the default target so that deployers who blindly execute the Ant task receive help.

  The "all" target is a shortcut for running the "clean" target followed
  by the "compile" target, to force a complete recompile.

-->

  <target name="all" depends="clean,compile"
   description="Clean build and dist, then compile"/>



<!-- ==================== Clean Target ==================================== -->

<!--

  The "clean" target deletes any previous "build" and "dist" directory,
  so that you can be ensured the application can be built from scratch.

<!--

  The "compile" target transforms source files (from your "src" directory)

  unpacked directory hierarchy under "/WEB-INF/classes".

<!--

  The "dist" target creates a binary distribution of your application
  in a directory structure ready to be archived in a tar.gz or zip file.
  Note that this target depends on two others:
  * "deploy" so that the entire web application (including external
    dependencies) will have been assembled
  * "javadoc" so that the application Javadocs will have been created

<!-- ==================== Javadoc Target ================================== -->

<!--

  The "javadoc" target creates Javadoc API documentation for the Java

<!-- ==================== Prepare Target ================================== -->

<!--

  The "prepare" target is used to create the "build" destination directory,
  and copy the static contents of your web application to it.  If you need
  to copy static files from external dependencies, you can customize the
  contents of this task.

  Normally, this task is executed indirectly when needed.

  </target>



<!-- ==================== DbLoader Target ================================= -->

<!--

  The "db" target runs uPortal's DbLoader program to load the database.
  WARNING: THIS MAY ERASE EXISTING uPORTAL TABLES!!!

  The "db" target accepts command line arguments which override values
  read from the dbloader.xml file:

  The "db" target can be invoked thusly:

  To use /properties/db/mytables.xml instead of the tables file specified in
  dbloader.xml:

  ant db -Dusetable=-t -Dtablefile=/properties/db/mytables.xml

  To use /properties/db/mydata.xml instead of the data file specified in
  dbloader.xml:

  ant db -Dusedata=-d -Ddatafile=/properties/db/mydata.xml

  Note: the tables and data files can both be overridden by combining the
  arguments.  The usetable and tablefile must be used in tandem and
  sequentially on the command line. Similarly, usedata and datafile must but
  used in tandem.

  Addtionally, several other boolean flags may be overridden.

  To set createScript=true
  ant db -Dcreatescript=-c

  To set createScript=false
  ant db -Dcreatescript=-nc

  To set dropTables=true
  ant db -Ddroptables=-D

  To set dropTables=false
  ant db -Ddroptables=-nD

  To set createTables=true
  ant db -Dcreatetables=-C

  To set createTables=false
  ant db -Dcreatetables=-nC

  To set populateTables=true
  ant db -Dpopulatetables=-P

  To set populateTables=false
  ant db -Dpopulatetables=-nP

  The -c, -nc, -D, -nD, -C, -nC, -P, -nP arguements may all be used
  independantly or in any combination although it would not make sense to,
  for example, use both -c and -nc.

  The "pubchan" target runs the ChannelPublisher tool.
  Channel definitions are defined in XML files.  Each
  channel definition is published or modified if one
  already existed with the same functional name.  You
  can publish all the channel definitions at once or just
  one at a time.
  Examples:
  ant pubchan -Dchannel=all

  and deploys the results to the servlet container.  You can deploy
  multiple portlets at once by placing them in the lib/portlets
  directory and specifying "all" as the porletApp.
  Examples:
  ant deployPortletApp -DportletApp=all
  ant deployPortletApp -DportletApp=C:/TEMP/myPortlet.war
