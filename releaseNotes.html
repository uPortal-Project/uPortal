<li>Tomcat 5.5.x  Other servlet containers may work. YMMV.  Less than latest patch releases of 
Tomcat may have serious known memory issues or other problems</li>
<li>Database (Oracle, Postgres, MySQL are commonly used in production; 
these and HSQLDB are commonly used in development; specific vendors and
