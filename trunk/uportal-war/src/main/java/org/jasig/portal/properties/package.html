		<p>
			Package for the PropertiesManager and its supporting classes, created as of uPortal 2.4.
			A stub PropertiesManager remains in the old org.jasig.portal.PropertiesManager location, which delegates all requests to this
			new PropertiesManager, for backwards compatibility.
			This package contains custom RuntimeExceptions thrown by PropertiesManager and a simple Servlet which will
			expose as XML the list of properties the PropertiesManager has been asked about but could not find.
