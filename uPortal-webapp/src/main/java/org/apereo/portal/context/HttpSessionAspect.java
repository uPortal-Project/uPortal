 * serialzable to the session. HttpSessionAspect is not needed at this point for any production
 * functionality; it is only used to identify classes that need to be modified to be serializable.
 *
 * <p>This is class is being included in the uPortal-webapp package so that as part of the uPortal
 * gradle build, the needed classes are available as part of the uPortal packaging. uPortal-start
 * will then pull needed instrumented classes and include them in the appropriate place within the
 * tomcat instance. This assumes that uPortal-start is being used to manage the installation into
