  <h2><a name="overview.types">Types of Channels</a></h2>
  <p>uPortal 2.0.1 supports six types of channels.  These are:</p>
  <table>
   <tr>
    <th> Channel Type </th>
    <th> Description </th>
    <th> What you must provide </th>
   </tr>
   <tr class="odd">
    <td> Image </td>
    <td>
     This is a simple channel type that is used to display an image with
     optional caption and subcaption.  The image may be a hyperlink to another
     page.
    </td>
    <td> Image url, hyperlink, optional caption and subcaption </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td> Inline Frame </td>
    <td>
     This type of channel is used to render an entire HTML page within a
     frame.  It doesn't work with Internet Explorer versions less than 5 or
     Netscape versions less than 6, and it doesn't work very well with Netscape
     6. 
    </td>
    <td> url of the html page </td>
   </tr>
   <tr class="odd">
    <td> RSS (Rich Site Summary) </td>
    <td>
     This is the most common type of channel.  All of the content is defined
     in an XML document, which must adhere to the RSS specification.
    </td>
    <td> url of the rss file </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td> Simple XML Transformation </td>
    <td>
     The channel's content is defined by an XML document, and the styling must
     be done with one or more XSL documents (written in XSLT).
    </td>
    <td> url of the XML file and the XSL file </td>
   </tr>
   <tr class="odd">
    <td> Web Proxy </td>
    <td>
     This is one way to incorporate an already-written web application.  If you
     are creating a new channel (that you need to be dynamic), however, it is
     recommended that you write a custom channel.  There is more information
     about using the web proxy channel type
     <a href="http://www.mun.ca/cc/portal/cw/">here</a>.
    </td>
    <td> url of the web application </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td> Custom </td>
    <td>
     This type of channel is used to publish channels that need to incorporate
     dynamic content.  It is the most general and powerful type of channel. 
     All of the other types of channels are subtypes of custom channels.
    </td>
    <td> Java class, XSL stylesheet(s) </td>
   </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
   Much uPortal content can (and should!) be developed using one of the
   first five types of channels.
   On the other hand, certain types of content, particularly dynamic content,
   requires more power than these methods have to offer.  For this type
   of power, a custom channel is in order.
  </p>
  <p>
   This document discusses the steps required to create a custom channel
   using the Java IChannel interface.
  </p>
  <h2><a name="overview.need">What you need to know</a></h2>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Java</b>: You will need to write a Java class that implements the
    IChannel interface.  This doesn't require extensive knowledge in Java, but
    it's best if you have an understanding of the basics of the language before
    you start.
   </li>
   <li><b>XML/XSLT</b>: Your Java code will produce XML, which will be styled
    with an XSL stylesheet.  You will have to write one or more XSL
    stylesheets, so an understanding of XML and XSLT is absolutely necessary.
    For more information on XML and XSL, I suggest
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1861005946/qid=1024323640/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_2/103-5801365-5002234">Beginning XSLT</a>
        by Jeni Tennison (published by WROX Press, 2002), 
       <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/javaxml2/">Java and XML</a>
        by Brett McLaughlin (O'Reilly &amp; Associates),
    or <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/xmlnut/">XML in a Nutshell</a>
        or by Elliotte Rusty Harold &amp; W. Scott Means
        (O'Reilly &amp; Associates).
    There is also some good, free information available in Michael Oltz's
    document,
    <a href="authoring.html">
     Writing a Channel for the uPortal
    </a>,
    as well as 
       <a href="http://www.nwalsh.com/docs/tutorials/xsl/">this site</a>,
    and many more that can be found with a simple web search...
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a name="overview.might">What you might want to know</a></h2>
  <ul>
   <li><b>SQL/JDBC</b>: If you want your channel to be able to store
    information between user visits, you'll probably need to store the
    information in a relational database.  Since the uPortal requires a
    relational database be already set up, it's a good place to store things
    anyway.  In order to do this, you will need to be familiar with SQL
    (the Structured Query Language) an JDBC (Java Database Connectivity API).
   </li>
   <li><b>Servlets</b>: The entire uPortal is build on Java servlet
    technology.  Understanding some basic concepts about HTTP, cgi, and/or
    servlets will help make clear what is really going on when you write a
    channel.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a name="overview.steps">The steps</a></h2>
   <p>
    Here are the steps you need to follow when writing your channel
    for uPortal 2.0.1.  
   </p>
   <ol>
   <li><a href="#getstarted">Prepare</a> to create your channel by deciding
    what your channel needs to do, and what you will call it.
   </li>
   <li><a href="#writejava">Write the Java code</a> to respond to user input
    and produce the content (in XML form) for your channel.
   </li>
   <li><a href="#writessl">Write a stylesheet list (SSL)</a> which describes
    each of the stylesheets your channel uses.
   </li>
   <li><a href="#writexsl">Write the stylesheet(s)</a> that will transform
    your XML into xhtml, which is sent to the user's browser.
   </li>
   <li><a href="#publish">Publish the channel</a> via the channel publishing
    mechanism that is built into uPortal 2.0.1.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <h1><a name="getstarted">Getting started</a></h1>
  <h2><a name="getstarted.whattodo">Decide what your channel will do</a></h2>
  <p>
   First thing to do is decide exactly what your channel will do.  Since you
   have decided your channel should be a custom Java channel, your channel
   probably has dynamic content (meaning it changes based on user input).  
  </p>
  <p>
   Try to envision just the <i>content</i> (not the presentation) of the output
   of your channel expressed as an XML string.  If you think there might be
   other situations where people would need to express similar content, you
   might try looking for a DTD or schema that suits your needs (one good place
   to look is
   <a href="http://www.xml.org/xml/registry.jsp">xml.org's XML registry</a>).
   Using a more general DTD or schema can be useful as your channel will be
   producing XML that you might be able to use outside of the uPortal as well
   as inside.
  </p>
  <table>
   <tr>
    <td class="example">
     Our example channel will take in a name, and then display "Hello" to that
     name.  The content of the output of the channel is merely a name, so the
     XML will look something like:
     <pre> &lt;name&gt;Owen&lt;/name&gt; </pre>
     Where "Owen" is the name we're trying to pass to the stylesheet.  
     <br /><br />
     The channel will also have an "About this channel" page, which simply
     displays some text describing the channel.  In this case, the content is
     that text that we need to display:
     <pre> &lt;about&gt;A bunch of text describing the channel&lt;/about&gt; 
     </pre>
    </td>
   </tr>
  </table>
  <h2><a name="getstarted.files">Naming and placing your files</a></h2>
  <p>
   Your Java source should be in a file with the same name as your channel,
   except that it has a 'C' prepended to it.  It goes in:
  </p>
     <pre>&lt;uportal-home&gt;/source/&lt;package&gt;/ </pre>
  <p>
   Note that with the quick-start distribution,
   <code>&lt;uportal-home&gt;</code> refers to the
   <code>uPortal_2-0-1-quick-start/uPortal_rel-2-0-1 directory</code>,
   and with the uPortal-only distribution it refers to the
   <code>uPortal_rel-2-0-1</code> directory.
  </p>
  <p>
   Your stylesheet list is usually named the same as your Java source, except
   instead of having a .java extension it has a .ssl extension.  It goes in:
  </p>
     <pre>&lt;uportal-home&gt;/webpages/stylesheets/&lt;package&gt;/ </pre>
  <p>
   The stylesheets are .xsl files, and can be named whatever you choose.  They
   go in the same directory as the stylesheet list file. 
  </p>
  <table>
   <tr>
    <td class="example">
     The example channel is called HelloWorld, so its Java source goes in
     CHelloWorld.java.  Since the package on the channel is: <br />
       <pre>edu.virginia.uportal.channels.helloworld</pre>
     The file locations for all the files that are used are as follows:
     <br />
       <pre>
&lt;uportal-home&gt;/source/edu/virginia/uportal/channels/helloworld/CHelloWorld.java
&lt;uportal-home&gt;/webpages/stylesheets/edu/virginia/uportal/channels/helloworld/CHelloWorld.ssl
&lt;uportal-home&gt;/webpages/stylesheets/edu/virginia/uportal/channels/helloworld/normal_explorer.xsl
&lt;uportal-home&gt;/webpages/stylesheets/edu/virginia/uportal/channels/helloworld/normal_netscape.xsl
&lt;uportal-home&gt;/webpages/stylesheets/edu/virginia/uportal/channels/helloworld/about.xsl</pre>
    </td>
   </tr>
  </table>

  <h1><a name="writejava">Writing the Java class</a></h1>
  <h2><a name="writejava.import">Import statements</a></h2>
   <p>There are some classes that are used by every channel for the uPortal.
    You'll need import statements for at least these classes.</p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td class="example">
      <pre>
// A channel needs these eight classes no matter what:
import org.jasig.portal.IChannel;
import org.jasig.portal.ChannelStaticData;
import org.jasig.portal.ChannelRuntimeData;
import org.jasig.portal.ChannelRuntimeProperties;
import org.jasig.portal.PortalEvent;
import org.jasig.portal.PortalException;
import org.jasig.portal.utils.XSLT;
import org.xml.sax.ContentHandler;

// This is only useful if you will be using Commons Logging (which you should!!):
import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;
import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;</pre>
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  <h2><a name="writejava.class">The class declaration</a></h2>
   <p>Your class must implement the <code>IChannel</code> interface, so this
    must be in the class declaration.</p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td class="example">
      <pre>public class CHelloWorld implements IChannel </pre>
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  <h2><a name="writejava.fields">Necessary fields</a></h2>
   <p>At the very least, you'll need to keep track of the static data and the
    runtime data that the portal sends you.  
   </p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td class="example">
      <pre>
private ChannelStaticData staticData;
private ChannelRuntimeData runtimeData;</pre>
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <p>Often your channel consists of a few different "views" or "pages."  One
    good way to deal with this is to enumerate the different pages and have
    some state for remember the current page.</p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td class="example">
      <pre>
private static final int NORMAL_MODE =    42; // two of my
private static final int ABOUT_MODE  = 31337; // favorite numbers
private int mode; // whether we're in NORMAL_MODE or ABOUT_MODE</pre>
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <p>You'll also need fields to keep track of any other state that you need
    for your channel.</p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td class="example">
      <pre>
private String name; // the name to say hello to
private String name_prev; // the name that was previously submitted, to go
                          // in the text box by default.</pre>
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  <h2><a name="writejava.constructor">The constructor</a></h2>
   <p>You can do any initialization you need in the constructor.  It will get
    called once as the uPortal is setting up your channel.
   </p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td class="example">
      <pre>
  /**
   *  Construct0r.
   */
  public CHelloWorld() {
    this.name = "World"; // default to "Hello World!"
    this.name_prev = ""; // start with the text box empty
    this.mode = NORMAL_MODE; // start in normal mode
  }</pre>
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  <h2><a name="writejava.ichannel">IChannel interface methods</a></h2>
   <p>
   The IChannel interface requires that you implement five methods.  These are
   described below.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <a name="writejava.ichannel.grp" />
     <h3>
      <code>public ChannelRuntimeProperties getRuntimeProperties()</code>
     </h3>
     <p>The purpose of this method is to provide a way for your channel to
     communicate runtime information to the portal.  You are supposed to
     construct an object of type <code>ChannelRuntimeProperties</code> and 
     return it.</p>
     <p>However, with the current implementation, literally nothing is done with
     this object once you return it, so there isn't much to do but return 
     a new object.</p>
     <table>
      <tr>
       <td class="example">
        <pre>

    <li>
     <a name="writejava.ichannel.re" />
     <h3><code>public void receiveEvent(PortalEvent ev)</code></h3>
     <p>This method is called when the user initiates some sort of layout event,
      for example they click on the 'detach' button, or the 'help' button.  
      Note that whether these buttons will even be present is specified when you
      publish the channel.</p>
     <p>Events are stored as both names and numbers.  If <code>ev</code> were
      an event you received, you could get the name like this:
     </p>
       <pre>String eventName = ev.getEventName();</pre>
     <p>And you could get the number like this: </p>
       <pre>int eventNumber = ev.getEventNumber();</pre>
     <p>The types of events that can be passed to receiveEvent are:</p>
      <table>

        <th> event number </th>
        <th> event name </th>

      to react to the event. 
     </p>

        In CHelloWorld, we will be responding to ABOUT_BUTTON_EVENT by

     <a name="writejava.ichannel.ssd" />
     <h3><code>public void setStaticData(ChannelStaticData sd)</code></h3>
      <p>This method is used by the uPortal to pass in static data to your
      channel.  Objects of type ChannelStaticData contain channel configuration
      items and parameters, including things like the channel's publish-time
      id, the channel's subscribe-time id, the IPerson object containing
      information on the user viewing your channel, and the channel's timeout
      in milliseconds.  
      </p>
      <p>Usually, all that needs to be done in this method is to store the
      ChannelStaticData object in a field.

      is rendered).  You are passed in a <code>ChannelRuntimeData</code>
      object, which you should store in a field for use later.  </p>
     <p>Usually any form processing that needs to be done is done here, as the
      http request variables come in with the ChannelRuntimeData.</p>

     <p>This is where you produce the XML that will be the contents of your
      page.  Most of the work is done using an <code>XSLT</code> object, which
      you construct and then use to set parameters for rendering the XML.
     </p>
     <p>Typical usage of the XSLT class looks like this:</p>
     <pre>
 XSLT xslt = new XSLT(this);
 xslt.setXML("myXMLDoc.xml");
 xslt.setSSL("myChannel.ssl", "aTitle", runtimeData.getBrowserInfo());
 xslt.setTarget(out);
 xslt.setStylesheetParameter("param1Name", "param1Value");
 xslt.setStylesheetParameter("param2Name", "param2Value");
 xslt.transform();</pre>
     <p>Through <code>setSSL</code>, you tell XSLT where your SSL file is,
      the title of the stylesheet you want to use, and the browser information
      that comes from the client.  Based on this information it selects
      which stylesheet to use for rendering your XML.
     </p>

  <h1><a name="writessl">Writing the stylesheet list</a></h1>
   <p>The stylesheet list is just that: a list of stylesheets.  You name a
    bunch of stylesheets and then describe the cases in which they should be
    used.  The attributes of stylesheets which differentiate them from one
    another are the stylesheet <code>title</code> and the stylesheet
    <code>media</code>.  The title is arbitrary, the media refers to the user's
    browser type.  
   </p>
   <p>The stylesheet list is an XML document containing a processing
    instruction (the thing inside the <code>&lt;? ?&gt;</code> tags) for
    each stylesheet.  Since it is an XML document, you must have beginning
    and ending <code>document</code> tags, even though they mean nothing in
    this context.

  <h1><a name="publish">Publishing the channel</a></h1>
   <p>Before you can try out your new channel, you need to <i>publish</i> it
    to the uPortal.  This means putting information about the channel into
    the uPortal database.</p>
   <p>Fortunately, there is a mechanism built in to the uPortal to help you
    publish a channel.  In order to use this mechanism, however, you need to
    be a privelaged uPortal user (to be precise, you need to belong to the
    "channel developers" group).  If you aren't a privelaged user, get someone
    who is in the Portal Administrators group (or log in as such a user) and
    add your username using the groups manager.  If this method doesn't work, or
    you don't know of any privelaged users, add an entry to the
    up_group_membership table in the database.  The SQL to add this entry
    would look something like this:</p>
    <pre>
INSERT INTO up_group_membership VALUES (14, 501, 'F')</pre>
   <p>
    where 14 is the id of the group you want to join (groups and their ids are
    listed in up_group) and 501 is your uPortal user id (users and their ids
    are listed in up_user).
   </p>
   <p>Having logged in as someone with the proper permissions, you should see
    a link in the top-right corner of the page that reads "Channel Admin."  
    Click it, and follow the instructions to publish your channel.
   </p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td class="example">
      Here are the steps used to publish HelloWorld:
      <ol>
       <li>Click "Channel Admin"</li>
       <li>Click "Publish A New Channel"</li>
       <li>Choose a <b>Custom</b> channel type.</li>
       <li>Fill out all the General Settings.  Under <b>Channel Class</b>
        answer "edu.virginia.uportal.channels.helloworld.CHelloWorld"</li>
       <li>When asked to <b>Add Parameters</b>, simply click "Next &gt;"</li>
       <li>Under <b>Channel Controls</b>, check the box next to <b>Has About</b>
        </li>
       <li>Add the channel to at least one category</li>
       <li>Add the channel to the "Everyone" group</li>
       <li>Review and click "Finish"</li>
      </ol>
      To test the hello world channel, go to "Customize", and add the channel
      to your layout.
