    The Groups Manager channel is a tool
    that runs within the uPortal framework that allows a user to
    manipulate groups, group memberships, and their permissions.
    </P>
    <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
    The uPortal 2.1 group service is a
    composite service made up of one or more component services. Each
    group service functions to represent group information in a
    consistent manner. The default implementation is delivered with a
    group service that uses the portal database as its source. Therefore,
    as delivered, the composite group service only has one component
    service that is called &quot;local&quot; A demo LDAP component
    service can be configured by uncommeting the ldap section in the
    property file compositeGroupServices.xml located in the
    /properties/group directory. This will setup an &quot;ldap&quot; service
    that uses the Columbia LDAP directory as its source. If you want to
    use another LDAP directory, you should modify the
    LDAPGroupStoreConfig.xml file located in the same file directory. It
    should also be kept in mind that group information from some services
    may be read-only. For a more detailed discussion of configuration
    issues, refer to the
    <B>

    <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
    The groups framework represents a
    network of groups. A group can be a member of zero or more groups.
    The group members have privileges assigned to them directly or by
    virtue of their membership in a containing group (i.e. inherited from
    the hierarchy of group memberships).  As such, the framework allows
    for multi-inheritance. This is important to realize while using the
    Groups Manager channel because the question soon arises where one
    starts the representation of the groups system. The uPortal 2.1 group
    service allows for the definition of special groups called root
    groups. A
    <B>
      root group
    </B>
    is a special group that is the parent of
    all groups of a specific entity type. Although the groups framework
    does not enforce this relationship, the groups manager channel
    requires root groups to organize the opening view. Root groups are
    also used by the search function to discover the entity types that
    can be searched. In the default implementation, the &quot;All
    categories&quot; group (see Figure 1) is the root group of all channel
    definition groups and the &quot;Everyone&quot; group is the root group of
    all IPerson groups. Root groups are defined in the portal properties
    file as properties named with the prefix
    &quot;org.jasig.portal.services.GroupService.key_&quot; followed by an
    entity type class name. These properties are used by a group service
    to determine which groups are root groups. The value of the property
    is the group key. This key takes the form groupServiceName.key in the
    default implementation. (See
    <I>
      <A href = "#appendix2">Appendix II: Creating New Root Groups</A>
    </I>
    for more details)
    </P>
    <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
    As mentioned above, the group members
    have permissions assigned to them directly or by virtue of their
    membership in a group. In regards to permissions owned by the Groups
    Manager channel, the distinguished group of
    <B>
      portal administrators
    </B>
    is an exception to this. This group does not have any privileges
    explicitly granted to them. Membership in this group implicitly
    grants all permissions within the Groups Manager by effectively
    ignoring permission checking. The portal administrators group is
    defined in the portal properties file with the property named
    org.jasig.portal.services.GroupService.key_org.jasig.portal.security.IPerson.PortalAdministrators.
    The value is the group key of the group which contains all portal
    administrators. The following entry is currently found in the portal
    properties file of the default installation:

    When the Groups Manager opens, the channel displays all root groups (see
    <A href = "#overview">Overview</A>
    above) for which the
    user has view permissions (see Figure 1). A group can be expanded by
    clicking on the
    <IMG SRC="images/expand.jpg" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
    icon or collapsed by clicking on the
    <IMG SRC="images/collapse.jpg" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0>
    icon. User permissions determine the group members that the user sees
    as well as the functions that are made available for each group
    member. Some functionality may also be withheld because the group
    service itself is read-only. If a user does not have permission to
    view a parent group (e.g. Faculty), but does have permissions for a
    sub-group (e.g. Tenured Professors), the parent group will not be
    visible. If the group Tenured Professors is not a member of any other
    group that is displayed, it will be invisible to the user from the
    tree view. The only way for the user to see the group is to search
    for it (See
    <A href = "#searching">Searching</A>
    below).

    A user can search for any entity type
    that is contained by a root group and for any group of such entities.
    With the default implementation, you can therefore search for
    IPersons, IEntityGroups of IPersons, IChannelDefinitions, and
    IEntityGroups of IChannelDefinitions. Searching is not available
    while in edit mode. To search for the group Tenured Professors (see
    Figure 5), change the first search argument to &quot;Group of Persons&quot;,
    the second argument to &quot;contains&quot; or &quot;starts with&quot; and the
    third argument to &quot;Tenured&quot;. If you only want to search within
    the currently selected group, click on the

      Search results

    element will be created that
    contains an element for each member of the result set, in this case,
    one element for Tenured Professors. The search element is a special
    non-persistent group (i.e. not saved to the groups data store) that
    has as its members all of the group members that were found as a
    result of the search arguments. This is a demonstration of the
    networked nature of the groups framework. The search element can be
    manipulated like any other persistent group element except it can not
    be edited. In this regard, it is like an element for a group held by
    a read only group service with the exception that you cannot assign
    permissions to a search element. Deleting a search element simply
    removes the element from the view and has no affect on the groups
    themselves. On the other hand, the search result elements held by the
    search element are &quot;real&quot; group members that can be manipulated
    like any other persistent group within the limits of the user&apos;s
    privileges. This includes being able to select the groups in order to
    add them to another group. Group members held by all component group
    services will be discovered once they are configured.  Group services

    At present, the Groups Manager channel
    does not have a function to create root groups for new entity types.
    In order to manage a new entity type through the Groups Manager
    channel, you must do the following:
    <BR>
    <BR>
    1. Create the new entity type class
    (e.g. org.jasig.portal.IBook).
    <BR>
    <BR>
    2. Use the groups framework to add the new entity type to the
    UP_ENTITY_TYPE datastore. This can be done by using the Groups
    framework class EntityTypes by running the instance method:
    <BR>
    <BR>
    addEntityType(Class.forName(&quot;org.jasig.portal.IBook&quot;), &quot;Books
    of all types&quot;)
    <BR>
    <BR>
    3. Use the groups framework to create a parent group for this entity
    type. Use the Groups framework service class static methods:
    <BR>
    <BR>
    GroupService.newGroup(Class.forName(&quot;org.jasig.portal.IBook&quot;))
    <BR>
    OR
    <BR>
    GroupService.newGroup(Class.forName(&quot;org.jasig.portal.IBook&quot;),
    amazonCom).
    <BR>
    <BR>
    4. Add a new property to portal properties assigning the group key of
    the group created in step 3 as a root group for the new type. This
    would look something like:
    <BR>
    <BR>
    org.jasig.portal.services.GroupService.key_org.jasig.portal.IBook
    =local.99
    <BR>
    OR
    <BR>
    org.jasig.portal.services.GroupService.key_org.jasig.portal.IBook
    =amazonCom.99

          This view is actually the Permissions Manager channel running in
          servant mode with the Groups Manager channel as the master channel.
          The Permissions Manager channel looks just like the Groups Manager
          channel because the first thing that Permissions Manager does is
          call up the Groups Manager channel in servant mode.
