/**
 * Advices for styling the main navigation ( aka mobile skicky nav > Animated toggle button + nav element + optional subnav (fly-out))
 * On mobile, the main nav is hided not with display:none for accessibility reasons but with negative z-index. And when a user clicks 
 * on the toggle button, the offcanvas folds and the inner elements of the nav move with a positive z-index on the left in the offcanvas region.
 * The animations are made with GPU animated CSS properties like transform: translate3d(x,y,z) or scale3d(x,y,z) etc.
 * Beware of bugs with z-index, static and fixed position (other than the fixed position of the sticky nav), 
 * these css properties should be use with delicacy and after understand well the Browser's Stacking context :
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=Understanding_CSS_z-index%2FThe_stacking_context
 * https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2012/09/Stacking-Changes-Coming-to-position-fixed-elements
 * http://codepen.io/paulirish/pen/CgAof (Paul Irish exemple showing the different layout behaviors)
 * http://codepen.io/Merri/pen/AtzmK (Static elements with opacity or transform gain relative positioning)
 * http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2011/09/12/un-fixing-fixed-elements-with-css-transforms/
 *  
 * Because the cascade of the nav's styles is hard to handle, use a mobile first partitioning strategy to override styles of the nav like follow. 
 * It will be more safer for you.
 * Do not forget to override the offcanvas fixes for ie9, ie10 and ie11 of common/less/tag.less within your custom skin.less, if you modify a lot the offcanvas. 
 * DO NOT MODIFY directly tags.less for your customSkin
