/**
 * Interface for a DOM serializer implementation, factory for DOM and SAX
 * serializers, and static methods for serializing DOM documents.
 * <p>
 * To serialize a document using SAX events, create a compatible serializer
 * using {@link #makeSAXSerializer} and pass it around as a {@link
 * DocumentHandler}. If an I/O error occurs while serializing, it will
 * be thrown by {@link DocumentHandler#endDocument}. The SAX serializer
 * may also be used as {@link DTDHandler}, {@link DeclHandler} and
 * {@link LexicalHandler}.
 * <p>
 * To serialize a DOM document or DOM element, create a compatible
 * serializer using {@link #makeSerializer} and call it's {@link
 * #serialize(Document)} or {@link #serialize(Element)} methods.
 * Both methods would produce a full XML document, to serizlie only
 * the portion of the document use {@link OutputFormat#setOmitXMLDeclaration}
 * and specify no document type.
 * <p>
 * The convenience method {@link #serialize(Document,Writer,OutputFormat)}
 * creates a serializer and calls {@link #serizlie(Document)} on that
 * serialized.
 * <p>
 * The {@link OutputFormat} dictates what underlying serialized is used
 * to serialize the document based on the specified method. If the output
 * format or method are missing, the default is an XML serializer with
 * UTF-8 encoding and now indentation.
